# Exodus
Exodus is a sci-fi top down shooter game. Inspired by other top down shooter games like Skyforce, with an arcade feeling to it. 

This is my first game created in unity for the Android platform. You can find the apk file to install the game, or if you want to improve the game yourself, feel free to download the entire project and edit it in unity. 

I do not take credits for the assets used in the game.
